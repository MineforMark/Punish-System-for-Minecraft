# Punish System

By MineforMark

## Info:
- This contains Punish.sk and Punishgui.sk
- Punish.sk works on its own
- Punishgui.sk requires punish.sk to work
- There are customizable punishment lengths at the start of the code
- Some punishments have verbal warnings first, if you don't want that, feel free to remove it
- This took a decent amount of time to code, I would appreciate it if you gave credit somehow or atleast didn't claim it as your own

### Permissions:
- staff.punish
- staff.blacklist - just for doxxing
